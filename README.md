## final product
#### the goal (achieved)
	drawing a compiled-at-runtime shader  
	R for recompiling and reloading the shader on the fly
	
	Q: why?
	A: don't care mate. makes it easier to learn/teach how to work with shaders or smth?

#### improving the idea (if i have some lifeforce left)
	drawing a semi-transparent text editor on top of the running shader
		(could actually use ImGUI for that?) 
	
	H for hiding/showing the text editor itself and revealing/covering the graphics
	
	Q: what's the point of going further?
	A: i want to flex with better application in front of my second ego! 
		(and supposedly show you how it's done 
			(though i have no clue right now...
				well, watching people struggle is quite entertaining nowadays innit))
